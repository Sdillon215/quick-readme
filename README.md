## Insallation
To run this application the user must first clone the repo from github. Once the files are on the users local device they need to install node.js and the inquirer package from NPM. Once those dependancies are install the app can be initialized by typing "node index" into the terminal. Simply answer the prompts and the ReadMe.md file will be created.

## Usage
As a developer working on many projects it is wonderful to have an app that will quickly create ReadMe.md files for my projects. I've actually used the app to write the file you are reading now!
